1. Someone is written the program PreProcessingHomework but it doesn't compile and it doesn't work. Fix it.
    Compile and debug the program: PreProcessingHomework.c.
    The program is done but there are some errors in it:
        One compilation error.
        Two logical errors.

    What program should do:    
        - Receive an unsigned short value and a bit number and check whether the corresponding bit in the vale is 1 or 0.
        The result after execution of the code should be:
            'bit = 1'
