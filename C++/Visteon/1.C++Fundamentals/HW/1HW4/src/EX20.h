//was not able to get to this exercise

//1. input T
//2. Input N and M numbers after words
//3. Store T and evaluate each time
//4. Each time N and M are asked to be entered there would be an additional
// structure node created and attached to the total structure list
//5.If the user wishes the sums and evaluations will be printed accordingly
